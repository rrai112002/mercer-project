# Mercor Time Tracker - Web Onboarding

This is a simple React application that serves as the web-based frontend for the mercor Time Tracker employee onboarding flow. Its primary purpose is to allow a newly invited employee to securely activate their account and set their password.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Token-Based Activation**: Securely activates user accounts using a unique token sent via email.
* **Password Creation**: Provides a clean interface for users to create and confirm their new password.
* **API Integration**: Communicates with the mercor Backend API to validate the token and update the user's account.
* **Success & Download**: After successful activation, it directs the user to a page where they can download the desktop tracking application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  An administrator invites a new employee via the backend API.
2.  The employee receives an email containing a unique activation link (e.g., `http://localhost:3000?token=...`).
3.  The employee clicks the link and is directed to this React application.
4.  The application reads the `token` from the URL.
5.  The user enters and confirms their desired password.
6.  On submission, the app sends the `token` and the new `password` to the backend's `/api/auth/activate` endpoint.
7.  If the backend confirms the token is valid, the user's account is activated, and this app displays a success page with download links for the desktop client.
